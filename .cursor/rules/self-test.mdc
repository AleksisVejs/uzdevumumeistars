## Self-Test Logic

- **Question Selection**: Randomly select questions from the topic's question bank, ensuring a mix of difficulty levels.
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Adjust the difficulty of subsequent questions based on the user's performance.
- **Time Constraints**: Implement a timer to simulate test conditions and encourage time management.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Provide immediate feedback on answers to facilitate learning.

## User Progress Tracking

- **Progress Storage**: Store user progress in the `user_topic_progress` table with fields for `status` and `attempts`.
- **Unlock Criteria**: Unlock subsequent topics based on passing the final test of the current topic.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Allow users to retake failed tests with a different set of questions.

## Frontend Interaction

- **UI Components**: Develop Vue components to display questions, options, and timers.
- **State Management**: Use Vuex to manage the state of the self-test, including current question, score, and timer.
- **User Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface with clear navigation and progress indicators.
