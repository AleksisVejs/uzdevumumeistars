## Gamification Features

- **XP System**: Award experience points (XP) for completing self-tests, final tests, and other activities.
- **Badges**: Grant badges for achieving milestones, such as completing all tests in a topic or maintaining a streak.
- **Leaderboards**: Display leaderboards to foster competition and motivation among users.

## User Progression

- **XP Tracking**: Store and update the user's XP in the `users` table.
- **Badge Assignment**: Assign badges based on predefined criteria and store them in a pivot table.
- **Streak Tracking**: Monitor and reset streaks based on user activity.

## Frontend Interaction

- **UI Components**: Develop Vue components to display XP, badges, and leaderboards.
- **State Management**: Use Vuex to manage the state of gamification features.
- **User Interface**: Design engaging and visually appealing interfaces to motivate users.
