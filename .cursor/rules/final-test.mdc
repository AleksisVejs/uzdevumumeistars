## Final Test Structure

- **Question Pool**: Each final test consists of a fixed number of questions randomly selected from the topic's question bank.
- **Passing Criteria**: Users must answer at least 70% of the questions correctly to pass.
- **Time Limit**: Implement a time limit to simulate real exam conditions.
- **Result Feedback**: Provide detailed feedback on performance, highlighting areas of strength and improvement.

## Backend Logic

- **Test Generation**: Dynamically generate final tests based on the topic's question bank.
- **Result Calculation**: Calculate the user's score and determine pass/fail status.
- **Progress Update**: Update the `user_topic_progress` table to reflect the user's performance.

## Frontend Interaction

- **UI Components**: Develop Vue components to display the final test questions, options, timer, and results.
- **State Management**: Use Vuex to manage the state of the final test, including current question, score, and timer.
- **User Interface**: Design a clean and intuitive interface with clear instructions and progress indicators.
